The Kinamine-Y-Shaker provides the Galaxy instance of the Kinamine tool described in the following paper (Perez, M., Blankenhorn, J., Murray, K. J., & Parker, L. L. (2019). High-throughput identification of FLT3 wild-type and mutant kinase substrate preferences and application to design of sensitive in vitro kinase assay substrates. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics, 18(3), 477-489.))
although this tool works with Peptide Shaker outputs instead of Protein Pilot outputs

The nbproject, src/kinamine, build.xml and manifest.mf files can all be imported directly into Netbeans in order to edit the java classes of this tool.

The .jar file is the executable of this tool

Kinamine.xml is the Galaxy wrapper of this tool
